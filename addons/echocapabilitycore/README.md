# ECHO: CapabilityCore

Runtime capability negotiation over descriptor provides and consumes so optional integrations are clean, inspectable, and fallback-safe.

## Review Status

This is a Phase 1 ECHO platform roadmap module and is ready for contract review. The first implementation is contract-first: descriptor metadata, native surface discovery, data contracts, docs, and release artifact metadata. It is not a finished gameplay/runtime implementation.

## Public Contracts

- Provides: `capability.registry`, `capability.negotiation`, `capability.missing_diagnostics`, `capability.fallbacks`
- Consumes: `module.graph`, `feature.graph`, `platform.contracts`
- MVP contracts: `capability_registry`, `missing_capability_diagnostics`, `graceful_fallback_api`

## Native Probe

The native entrypoint reports the standard roadmap activation map: `activated`, `activationStage`, `adapterCoreUsed`, `nativeAdapterCodeExecuted`, `moduleId`, `packId`, `registeredFeatureContracts`, `logicalRegistrationCount`, `adapterDomains`, `runtimeTargets`, `referenceProbe`, `registryMutated: false`, and `transformsPerformed: false`.

## Contract Boundary

This module exposes schemas, descriptors, data contracts, artifact metadata, and native surface probes only. Deeper gameplay behavior, runtime state mutation, player-facing loops, server operations, and destructive writes must land in later implementation work behind validation and policy gates.
