# ECHO: AccessibilityCore

Readable HUD scale, reduced motion, contrast themes, captions, prompt remaps, and narration metadata contracts.

## Review Status

This is a Phase 3 ECHO platform roadmap module and is ready for contract review. The first implementation is contract-first: descriptor metadata, native surface discovery, data contracts, docs, and release artifact metadata. It is not a finished gameplay/runtime implementation.

## Public Contracts

- Provides: `accessibility.settings`, `accessibility.validation`, `accessibility.narration_metadata`
- Consumes: `theme.tokens`, `screen.surface`, `input.bindings`, `sound.audio_profiles`
- MVP contracts: `accessibility_settings_contract`, `validation_checks`, `caption_metadata`, `prompt_remaps`

## Native Probe

The native entrypoint reports the standard roadmap activation map: `activated`, `activationStage`, `adapterCoreUsed`, `nativeAdapterCodeExecuted`, `moduleId`, `packId`, `registeredFeatureContracts`, `logicalRegistrationCount`, `adapterDomains`, `runtimeTargets`, `referenceProbe`, `registryMutated: false`, and `transformsPerformed: false`.

## Contract Boundary

This module exposes schemas, descriptors, data contracts, artifact metadata, and native surface probes only. Deeper gameplay behavior, runtime state mutation, player-facing loops, server operations, and destructive writes must land in later implementation work behind validation and policy gates.
