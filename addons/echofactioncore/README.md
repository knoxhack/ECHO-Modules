# ECHO: FactionCore

Factions, reputation, standings, vendors, hostility, alliances, territory hooks, and mission consequence contracts.

## Review Status

This is a Phase 4 ECHO platform roadmap module and is ready for contract review. The first implementation is contract-first: descriptor metadata, native surface discovery, data contracts, docs, and release artifact metadata. It is not a finished gameplay/runtime implementation.

## Public Contracts

- Provides: `faction.registry`, `faction.reputation`, `faction.standings`, `faction.mission_consequences`
- Consumes: `mission.objectives`, `economy.pricing`, `social.factions`, `social.reputation`
- MVP contracts: `faction_registry`, `reputation_state`, `standing_rules`, `mission_consequence_hooks`

## Native Probe

The native entrypoint reports the standard roadmap activation map: `activated`, `activationStage`, `adapterCoreUsed`, `nativeAdapterCodeExecuted`, `moduleId`, `packId`, `registeredFeatureContracts`, `logicalRegistrationCount`, `adapterDomains`, `runtimeTargets`, `referenceProbe`, `registryMutated: false`, and `transformsPerformed: false`.

## Contract Boundary

This module exposes schemas, descriptors, data contracts, artifact metadata, and native surface probes only. Deeper gameplay behavior, runtime state mutation, player-facing loops, server operations, and destructive writes must land in later implementation work behind validation and policy gates.
